# Spring Boot Microservice - Apache Camel - CXF SOAP Service

A docker container created with Spring Boot exposing a SOAP endpoint for a legacy client using Apache Camel

## Starting Services Locally Without Docker

In order to run the project type in root folder:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Usage

To get the available endpoints, write in the browser:

```
http://localhost:8081/soap
```

![services](./doc/img/services-list.png?raw=true)

To get the wsdl of the service, write in the browser:

```
http://localhost:8081/soap/service/employee?wsdl
```

![services](./doc/img/wsdl-generation.png)

We can test the application using an Http Client like PostMan or Jmeter using a POST call (the application uses for the test cases RestAssured library). 

In this case, we'll use SoapUI, the endpoint for the service is: `http://localhost:8081/soap/service/employee`

## WSDL and Domain Model

In our example, we are going to work in a fictitious Employee  SOAP service with 2 operations:

* GetEmployeeById
* GetEmployeeByName

For the demo, I separated the XSD from the WSDL. In a real scenario, this will be the most followed pattern but expect to have more than one XSD in different folders. The [employee.xsd](/src/main/resources/wsdl/employee.xsd) has the full domain model for the service, next diagram shows the main response sent back to the client

![XSD Schema](./doc/img/xsd-employeesresponse.png?raw=true)

The WSDL is used for describing the functionality of the SOAP-based webservice. From all the sections in the WSDL file, the most important for us is the `wsdl:portType`. This section defines the interface for the service we want to implement: operations, input, and output parameters:

![portType diagram](./doc/img/porttype-diagram.png?raw=true)

<a name="portType"></a>Next is the WSDL section for `wsdl:portType`:
```xml
<!--This element defines the service operations and the combination of input and output elements to clients-->
<wsdl:portType name="EmployeeServicePortType">
    <wsdl:operation name="GetEmployeeById">
        <wsdl:input message="tns:EmployeeByIdRequest"/>
        <wsdl:output message="tns:EmployeeResponse"/>
    </wsdl:operation>
    <wsdl:operation name="GetEmployeesByName">
        <wsdl:input message="tns:EmployeeByNameRequest"/>
        <wsdl:output message="tns:EmployeesResponse"/>
    </wsdl:operation>
</wsdl:portType>
```
The complete WSDL file is here: [EmployeeServices.wsdl](/src/main/resources/wsdl/EmployeeServices.wsdl)


## To Get Health Check

To show a summary of spring boot health check

```
curl -XGET -s http://localhost:8081/actuator/health
```

And you can see some info details as well

```
curl -XGET -s http://localhost:8081/actuator/info
```

See the `application.properties` to control what information to present in actuator.

## Camel Developer Console

This application includes `camel-console-starter` which is a basic developer console
that is accessible as a Spring Boot actuator endpoint via:

```
curl -XGET -s http://localhost:8081/actuator/camel
```

For example to get route information:

```
curl -XGET -s http://localhost:8081/actuator/camel/routes
```

## Camel CLI

This application is integrated with the Camel CLI via the `camel-cli-connector-starter` dependency (see `pom.xml`).
This allows to use the Camel CLI to manage this application, such as:

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

And then use the CLI to see status:

```
camel get
PID   NAME                          CAMEL   PLATFORM            READY  STATUS   AGE  TOTAL  FAILED  INFLIGHT  SINCE-LAST
86000  sample.camel.MyCamelApplicaâ€¦  3.19.0  Spring Boot v2.7.3   1/1   Running  11s      5       0         0          0s
```
